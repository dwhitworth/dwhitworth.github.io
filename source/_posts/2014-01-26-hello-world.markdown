In a few days I'll be heading to Austin to attend an immersive, boot-camp style course in full stack Web development called [MakerSquare](http://www.themakersquare.com).
<!-- more -->
I'm beyond excited, as we'll be covering some great tools and technologies:

+ Ruby & Ruby on Rails
+ JavaScript
+ HTML and CSS
+ jQuery
+ Sinatra
+ backbone.js and riot.js
+ APIs
+ SQL (I imagine SQLite and PostgreSQL)
+ Git

and tons more. We'll spend 10+ hours a day, every day, for 10 weeks learning technologies, building projects, networking, participating in hackathons, etc. Hopefuly, the 400+ hours I have spent in self-study and the 800+ hours I'll spend at MakerSquare will have given me enough knowledge to build some cool apps, and allow me to be useful to someone as a professional (junior) software engineer somewhere.

I've been doing self-study since July and here are some of the resources I have completed in the past 6 months:

Books:

+ *Learn To Program* by Chris Pine
+ *CLI The Hard Way* by Zed A. Shaw
+ *Learn Ruby The Hard Way* by Zed A. Shaw
+ *Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning* by Andy Hunt
+ *Programming Ruby* (The "Pickaxe") by Dave Thomas with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt
+ *Practical Object-Oriented Design In Ruby* by Sandi Metz
+ *Eloquent Javascript* by Marijn Haverbeke
+ *Eloquent Ruby* by Russ Olsen

Online Resources:

[CodeAcademy](http://codecademy.com) - I've finished the Web Fundamentals, JavaScript, jQuery and Ruby tracks.

[Code School](http://codeschool.com) - Try Ruby, Ruby Bits I and II, Rails for Zombies I and II, JavaScript Road Trip I, II and III, CSS Cross Country, Try Git, Try jQuery.

[Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) - Earned over 75 achievements including courses on Ruby, Rails, JS, SQL, HTML and CSS

[Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.org) - Finished the Ruby Primer

I've also gone through a few tutorials on regular expressions, and some code challenge sites such as [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com) and [Rubeque](http://rubeque.herokuapp.com).

Class starts on February 4 and I plan to spend the next couple of weeks diving into backbone.js a little bit, getting a bit deeper into jQuery and getting through as much of the [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org) as I can.

I've been spending almost all of my free time learning these technologies and going through tutorials, but not actually building anything. The school recommends having a blog, so rather than build a blog using Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger or some other CMS, I thought it would be much hacker-ier to build it in Octopress and push it to Github and have it hosted through Github Pages.

So, here it is ... my first web app ... my blog.
