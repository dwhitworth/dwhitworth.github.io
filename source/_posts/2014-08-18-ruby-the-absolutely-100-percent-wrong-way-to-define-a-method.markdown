The app that I am building and maintaining contains travel and geographical information for a bunch of destinations around the World. I was tasked to build an API for our database that would serve some JSON to an iOS app. Simple enough. In the database that I created everything was pretty simply and logically named (so I thought), but I knew ahead of time that there was going to be some data transformation, so I decide to implement [ActiveModel::Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) for easy encapsulation and customization of the JSON object that I was delivering via my API.

Without doing much, my app would deliver a JSON object that looked something like this:

<code>{ "id": 1, "description": "This is a description", "latitude": "33.9425째 N", longitude: "33.9425째 N" }</code>

<!-- more -->

Surely, the names couldn't be that different in the iOS client that needed the data? Even so, it's pretty easy to transform data in ActiveModel::Serializer by defining custom attributes. Say you wanted to change the name of "description" to info in your JSON, you would just do this in your serializer:
``` ruby
class AreaSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :info

  def info
    object.description
  end

end
```
Easy, right? Well, whoever created the iOS app decided that they wanted the JSON object to look something like this:

<code>
{ "Area info page (400 characters)": "This is a description", "center latitude": "33.9425째 N", "center longitude": "33.9425째 N" }

It couldn't be changed, as the iOS app was using legacy code that no one wants to change, so the ummm... flexibility had to done on my end. Well, not only is that naming convention completely strange and eff'd up, how do I make a method name with spaces in it (also completely wrong and eff'd up)? Basically I need the above code to look like this:

``` ruby
class AreaSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :"Area info page (400 characters)"

  def Area info page (400 characters)
    object.description
  end

end
```

One of the reasons I love Ruby (and one of the reasons you should be really careful, since Ruby lets you get away with shit like this)... define_method! Here's how you make really awful looking method names (kids, don't try this at home):

``` ruby
class AreaSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :"Area info page (400 characters)"

  define_method("Area info page (400 characters)") do
    object.description
  end

end
```
And there you go! If you need to write some really horrible looking method names in Ruby, that's how you do it. Until next time...
