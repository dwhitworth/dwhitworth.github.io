So, I got through the first day of MakerSquare.

We went through introductions and course structure and an open Q&A with the founders, instructors and a couple of alumni. I have been truly impressed with what the students have been able to create after 10 grueling weeks here.

After the introductions, we went through a short tutorial on Git and GitHub, and although it was covered in the pre-work and most of it was review, I definitely learned that I have to break some bad habits.

For example, I am using Git for this blog, and when I add files to Git, I have been using the <code>git add .</code> command.... Wrong!

<code>git add .</code> blindly adds any file in the directory to your commit, so that means it's too easy to add files you didn't want to commit to your repository. It's better to use <code>git add [filename]</code> or even <code>git add -p</code>, which will give you a yes/no confirmation for each file it adds to your commit.

The second half of the day was doing some challenges in Ruby. I found these to be fairly trivial, but good review nonetheless. I imagine tomorrow will be harder.

I'll sleep better tonight ... I hope.
