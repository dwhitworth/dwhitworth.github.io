Since my first job as a journalist, I had been coding or editing websites in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (we're talking Web 1.0 here), but only very basic edits, and a lot of copy/paste when it came to JavaScript functionality. I enjoyed it, but I really didn't think to take it much further when I was concentrating on my music career.
