Welcome to my blog. Since this is my initial post, I'll use it to introduce myself and give you a little background on me.

My name is Donovan Whitworth and I am currently lead software engineer for [Bound Round](https://www.boundround.com), a company that makes booking tours, activities and excursions easier for traveling families.

I've had a colourful and varied career history. Although I have always been a passionate technologist (My first programming experience was learning BASIC on an Apple ][ computer), I initially studied music and communications in college. My first real job was as the editorial assistant for a trade magazine called Video Store Magazine. I was fairly quickly promoted to Assistant Editor, and spent a couple of years as a journalist. I have always played in bands as a hobby, but I stumbled into a band that had enough commercial momentum (note I said "momentum" not "money") to convince me to quit my job. The band didn't amount to much, but we did get signed to a deal with DreamWorks SKG (we never released a CD), and we did tour Australia, where I met my wife!

After our return from Australia, I worked as a composer and studio manager at Matter Music, the music studio that produced my band. It was an amazing experience, as we mostly wrote and recorded music for film and television, and we were fortunate enough to have written and performed music for some major TV shows and films (most notably The Wedding Crashers, The New Adventures of Old Christine, and The Fresh Beat Band). After 6 years working at Matter, a friend and I opened our own studio, Sloan Fox Music Laboratory, where we continued to produce music for television, although to much less success.

Since my first job as a journalist, I had been coding or editing websites in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (we're talking Web 1.0 here), but only very basic edits, and a lot of copy/paste when it came to JavaScript functionality. I enjoyed it, but I really didn't think to take it much further when I was concentrating on my music career. That said, 2009 and 2010 were VERY down years for me financially, and in 2010, we welcomed the birth of our first child. All of a sudden I needed to get a haircut and get a real job!

So, get a job I did, with a boutique golfing equipment manufacturer in North Hollywood called KZG. I initially started out in sales, but after a few months, and primarily because the outgoing Marketing Director couldn't successfully find a replacement, I was promoted to Marketing Manager. I was not enamoured of the work environment or the pay and I was always looking for a way out, but I really didn't know what to do.

To Be Continued.......
