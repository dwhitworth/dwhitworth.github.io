Welcome to my blog. Since this is my initial post, I'll use it to introduce myself and give you a little background on me.

My name is Donovan Whitorth and I am currently a software developer for [Bound Round](https://www.boundround.com), a company that makes booking tours, activities and excursions easier for traveling families.

I've had a colorful and varied career history. Although I had always been a passionate technologist (My first programming experience was learning BASIC on an Apple ][ computer), I spent the first part of my post high school years studying music and communications. My first real job was as the editorial assistant for a trade magazine called Video Store Magazine. I was fairly quickly promoted to Assistant Editor, and spent a few years as a journalist. I had always been playing in bands as a hobby, but I stumbled into a band that had enough commercial success to require me to quit my job - meaning the band was busy and there was enough money there to barely feed us and get through a couple of tours.
